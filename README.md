## Description

This project is the final project exam i had when attending Noroff Higher Vocational College for my Frontend development education.
We were tasked to make an social media platform with [Noroff's API](https://noroff-api-docs.netlify.app), it is made with students and staff in mind as you can only register with an @stud.noroff.no or @noroff.no email.

On the platform you can create posts with or without images and you can comment and react with emojis on the post you and/others have created.
You can also follow and be followed by others, add a profile image/avatar and profile banner.

You are able to edit and delete posts as well.

## Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com)


## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kimobv/project-exam-2.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running

Here is where you detail how to run the app. It typically involves the commands you'd need to run to start the project e.g.

To run the app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Using the platform

You can register and login to the platform using a faux email, the only criteria is that you use either ``@stud.noroff.no`` or ``@noroff.no`` when registering your user.
Also keep in mind that the email you use to register and login with is **___case sensitive___** as of now, so if you capitalize any letters when registering you will need to have the **___same formatting___ when logging in.**

if you don't wish to register you can log in and test the platform using these credentials:
```
email: lemon@stud.noroff.no
password: 123Passord
```
