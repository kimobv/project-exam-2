# HOWLER!

Welcome to Howler! a social media platform for students @ noroff.

### This is my submission for Noroffs Project Exam 2.

You can [view the project here](https://howler-app.netlify.app)

The platform uses [Noroffs API](https://noroff-api-docs.netlify.app/) & [These Endpoints](https://nf-api.onrender.com/docs/static/index.html).

## Goal
To take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidate's general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

## Brief
An existing Social Media company has approached you to create a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end social media application.

## Planning

- Trello  (kanban-board)
- Clickup  (gantt chart)
- Post-its  (I'm old-school like that)

## Hosting
- github
- Netlify

## Libraries and Frameworks

- React-App
- React-router-dom
- React-Bootstrap
- Sass
- Yup
- React-hook-form
- Axios
- Moment

## Setup

- Download or clone this repository
- Navigate to the root folder in the terminal.
#### First install the project 
```bash
npm install
```
#### Then run to start the app on a local server
```bash
npm run start
```
The application will open on "localhost" port 3000, if the port is busy it will ask to open at next availible port 3001, 3002, etc.

## Register
Username:
- Beware of caps, as of now the email-adress you register is case-sensitive
- If you register email "John.Appleseed@noroff.no" you will not be able to login with "john.appleseed@noroff.no".
- In addition to this the domain of your email must be either "@stud.noroff.no" or "@noroff.no" to be accepted.

Password:
- needs to be at least 8 characters long to be accepted.

Optional:
- You can add the url to your favorite profile banner and avatar here ( or you can do it later on your profile.

## Login
Use your chosen email-address and password to log in.

#### If you suddenly are unable to use your username and password the API might have been purged as it's still in development.

## Summary
This exam was originally to be done over a period of 7 weeks, due to unforseen events in my private life that led to me needing to be elsewhere on and off for the first 5 weeks of this project I have gotten to test myself and my own discipline during the hours I've worked on assignment.

I was given an 5 days extension to get everything done, and I have, and I haven't. There's 2000 things I'd like to adjust, add and remove - but alas, a deadline is a deadline.
